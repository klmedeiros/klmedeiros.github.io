The best way to contact Kaelen is through email at kaelenmedeiros at gmail dot com. 
<br>

To read their opinions on statistics and cats, [**Twitter**](http://twitter.com/kaelen_medeiros) is a good place to start. <br>
 
If [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaelen-medeiros-b0aab547/) is more your bag, click to go there and see a pretty cute headshot + more detailed info on Kaelen's work. <br>

If their work interests you, try their [**Github**](http://github.com/klmedeiros) repository, though much of the code they write is proprietary, and therefore not visible.
